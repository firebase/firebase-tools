## User Instructions

${prompt || "<the user didn't supply specific instructions>"}

## Steps

Follow the steps below taking note of any user instructions provided above.

1. If there is no active user, prompt the user to run \`firebase login\` in an interactive terminal before continuing.
2. Analyze the source code in the current working directory to determine if this is a web app. If it isn't, end this process and tell the user "The /deploy command only works with web apps."
3. Analyze the source code in the current working directory to determine if the app requires a server for Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This will determine whether or not to use Firebase App Hosting. Here are instructions to determine if the app needs a server:
  Objective: Analyze the provided codebase files to determine if the web application requires a backend for Server-Side Rendering (SSR). Your final output must be a clear "Yes" or "No" followed by a brief justification.
  Primary Analysis: package.json
    This is the most critical step. If the package.json file is present, perform the following checks in order.
    Parse package.json: Locate and read the contents of the package.json file.
      Check Dependencies:
        Examine the dependencies and devDependencies objects.
        If any of the following packages are listed as keys, you can conclude the app uses SSR.
          next
          nuxt
          @sveltejs/kit
          @angular/ssr
          remix
        If a match is found, proceed directly to the Final Determination step.
      Check Scripts: If no framework dependency was found, examine the scripts object.
        Look for scripts (commonly start or serve) that execute a server process.
        Examples include: "start": "next start", "start": "nuxt start", or "dev": "ng serve --ssr".
        If such a script is found, conclude the app uses SSR and proceed to the Final Determination step.
  Secondary Analysis: Project File Structure
    Perform this analysis only if package.json is missing or inconclusive.
    Scan for Framework-Specific Files and Directories: Search the codebase for the following patterns:
      Next.js: A directory named app/ or pages/. Inside these, check for files containing the function name getServerSideProps.
      Nuxt.js: A directory named server/.
      SvelteKit: Any file ending with the .server.js suffix (e.g., +page.server.js, +layout.server.js).
      Angular: A file named server.ts.
    If any of these patterns are found, conclude the app uses SSR.
  Final Determination
    State Your Conclusion: Begin your response with a definitive "Yes" or "No".
      Yes: The application requires a backend for SSR.
      No: The application does not appear to require a backend for SSR and is likely a static or client-side rendered app.
    Provide Justification: Follow your conclusion with a single sentence explaining the evidence.
      Example (Yes): "Yes, the project requires SSR, as evidenced by the next dependency in package.json."
      Example (Yes): "Yes, the project requires SSR, as evidenced by the presence of a +page.server.js file."
      Example (No): "No, there are no dependencies or file structures that indicate the use of a server-side rendering framework."
4. If there is no \`firebase.json\` file, manually create one based on whether the app requires SSR:
  4a. If the app requires SSR, configure Firebase App Hosting:
     Create \`firebase.json\ with an "apphosting" configuration, setting backendId to the app's name in package.json: \`{"apphosting": {"backendId": "<backendId>"}}\ 
  4b. If the app does NOT require SSR, configure Firebase Hosting:
    Create \`firebase.json\ with a "hosting" configuration. Add a \`{"hosting": {"predeploy": "<build_script>"}}\` config to build before deploying.
5. Check if there is an active Firebase project for this environment (the \`firebase_get_environment\` tool may be helpful). If there is, proceed using that project. If there is not an active project, give the user two options: Use an existing Firebase project or Create a new one. Wait for their response before proceeding.
  5a. If the user chooses to use an existing Firebase project, the \`firebase_list_projects\` tool may be helpful. Set the selected project as the active project (the \`firebase_update_environment\` tool may be helpful).
  5b. If the user chooses to create a new project, use the \`firebase_create_project	\` tool. Then set the new project as the active project (the \`firebase_update_environment\` tool may be helpful).
6. If firebase.json contains an "apphosting" configuration, check if a backend exists matching the provided backendId (the \`apphosting_list_backends\` tool may be helpful). 
   If it doesn't exist, create one by running the \`firebase apphosting:backends:create --backend <backendId> --primary-region us-central1 --root-dir .\` shell.
7. Only after making sure Firebase has been initialized, run the \`firebase deploy\` shell command to perform the deploy. This may take a few minutes.
  7a. If deploying to apphosting, tell the user the deployment will take a few minutes, and they can monitor deployment progress in the Firebase console: \`https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<projectId>/apphosting\`
8. If the deploy has errors, attempt to fix them and ask the user clarifying questions as needed.
9. If the deploy needs \`--force\` to run successfully, ALWAYS prompt the user before running \`firebase deploy --force\`.
10. If only one specific feature is failing, use command \`firebase deploy --only <feature>\` as you debug.
11. If the deploy succeeds, your job is finished.
