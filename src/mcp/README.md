> [!NOTE]  
> The Firebase MCP Server is considered **experimental** and subject to breaking changes in _minor_ version updates of the Firebase CLI.

The Firebase MCP Server provides tools to interact with Firebase project resources in compatible AI-assisted development environments.

## Usage

The Firebase MCP server uses the Firebase CLI for authentication and project selection. You will usually want to start the server with a specific target directory as an argument to serve as the "project folder" where your `firebase.json` is or will be.

For global clients that don't operate within a specific workspace, the Firebase MCP Server makes tools available to read and write a project directory.

### Client Configuration

If you are using an MCP client that is configured with a JSON, the following example configuration should help you get started:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firebase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firebase-tools", "mcp", "--dir", "."]
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

The Firebase MCP Server shares authentication with the Firebase CLI. If you've never used the Firebase CLI before, you'll need to login:

```bash
npx -y firebase-tools login
```

### Command Line Options

- `--dir <absolute_dir_path>`: The absolute path of a directory containing `firebase.json` (or where you want to initialize `firebase.json`) to set a workspace context for the MCP server. If unspecified, the working directory where the server is started is used. The `{get|update}_project_environment` can be used to interactively change the project directory.
- `--only <feature1,feature2>`: A comma-separated list of feature groups to activate. Use this to limit the tools exposed to only features you are actively using.

## Tools

| apphosting_list_backends               | apphosting    | Retrieves a list of App Hosting backends in the current project. An empty list means that there are no backends. The `uri` is the public URL of the backend. A working backend will have a `managed_resources` array that will contain a `run_service` entry. That `run_service.service` is the resource name of the Cloud Run service serving the App Hosting backend. The last segment of that name is the service ID. `domains` is the list of domains that are associated with the backend. They either have type `CUSTOM` or `DEFAULT`. Every backend should have a `DEFAULT` domain. The actual domain that a user would use to conenct to the backend is the last parameter of the domain resource name. If a custom domain is correctly set up, it will have statuses ending in `ACTIVE`. |
