The Firebase Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server gives AI-powered development tools the ability to work with your Firebase projects and your app's codebase. The Firebase MCP server works with any tool that can act as an MCP client, including: [Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/studio), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), VS Code Copilot, [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), and more!

## Features

An editor configured to use the Firebase MCP server can use its AI capabilities to help you:

- **Create and manage Firebase projects** - Initialize new projects, list existing ones, and manage Firebase apps
- **Manage Firebase Authentication users** - Retrieve, update, and manage user accounts
- **Work with Cloud Firestore and Firebase Data Connect** - Query, read, write, and manage database documents
- **Retrieve Firebase Data Connect schemas** - Generate schemas and operations with AI assistance
- **Understand security rules** - Validate and retrieve security rules for Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Realtime Database
- **Send messages with Firebase Cloud Messaging** - Send push notifications to devices and topics
- **Access Crashlytics data** - Debug issues, view crash reports, and manage crash analytics
- **Deploy to App Hosting** - Monitor backends and retrieve logs
- **Work with Realtime Database** - Read and write data in real-time
- **Query Cloud Functions logs** - Retrieve and analyze function execution logs
- **Manage Remote Config** - Get and update remote configuration templates

Some tools use [Gemini in Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-assistance) to help you:

- Generate Firebase Data Connect schema and operations
- Consult Gemini about Firebase products

> **Important:** Gemini in Firebase can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. It may respond with inaccurate information that doesn't represent Google's views. Validate all output from Gemini before you use it and don't use untested generated code in production. Don't enter personally-identifiable information (PII) or user data into the chat.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a working installation of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/).

### Basic Configuration

The Firebase MCP server can work with any MCP client that supports standard I/O (stdio) as the transport medium. When the Firebase MCP server makes tool calls, it uses the same user credentials that authorize the Firebase CLI in the environment where it's running.

Here are configuration instructions for popular AI-assistive tools:

#### Gemini CLI

Install the [Firebase extension for Gemini CLI](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/firebase/):

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/firebase/
```

#### Claude Code

To configure Claude Code to use the Firebase MCP server, run the following command under your app folder:

```bash
claude mcp add firebase npx -- -y firebase-tools@latest mcp
```

You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

It should show:

```
firebase: npx -y firebase-tools@latest mcp - âœ“ Connected
```

#### Cursor

Add to `.cursorrules` in your project directory or configure in Cursor settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firebase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firebase-tools@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firebase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firebase-tools@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Firebase Studio

To configure Firebase Studio to use the Firebase MCP server, edit or create the configuration file: `.idx/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firebase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firebase-tools@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, the MCP server will automatically provide Firebase capabilities to your AI assistant. You can:

- Ask the AI to help set up Firebase services
- Query your Firestore database
- Manage authentication users
- Deploy to Firebase Hosting
- Debug Crashlytics issues
- And much more!

For a complete list of available tools and resources, see the [Server Capabilities](#server-capabilities) section below.

## Documentation

## Server Capabilities

The Firebase MCP server provides three types of capabilities: **Tools** (functions that perform actions), **Prompts** (reusable command templates), and **Resources** (documentation files for AI models).

| apphosting_list_backends              | apphosting       | Use this to retrieve a list of App Hosting backends in the current project. An empty list means that there are no backends. The `uri` is the public URL of the backend. A working backend will have a `managed_resources` array that will contain a `run_service` entry. That `run_service.service` is the resource name of the Cloud Run service serving the App Hosting backend. The last segment of that name is the service ID. `domains` is the list of domains that are associated with the backend. They either have type `CUSTOM` or `DEFAULT`. Every backend should have a `DEFAULT` domain. The actual domain that a user would use to conenct to the backend is the last parameter of the domain resource name. If a custom domain is correctly set up, it will have statuses ending in `ACTIVE`. |
