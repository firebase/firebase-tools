### Setup Firestore Database

**Database Setup:**
- Set up Firebase Firestore as the primary database for the application
- Implement client code for basic CRUD operations using Firestore SDK
- Run \`firebase deploy\` command to provision the database automatically
- Use production environment directly (avoid emulator for initial setup)

**Verification & Testing:**
- Only proceed to verification after running the \`firebase deploy\` command
- Guide developers to verify database creation at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Navigate to "Firestore Database" in the left navigation to confirm database creation
- Ask developers to test their application and confirm they can see test data in the console
- Only proceed to the next step after confirmation

**Security:**
- Recommend implementing authentication if the application handles sensitive user data
- Guide users to navigate to "Firestore Database" â†’ "Rules" tab to configure security rules
- **Warning**: Never make Firestore security rules public (allowing read/write without authentication)
