- Follow Firebase security best practices for rules and authentication
- Always use structured logging in Firebase Functions with the firebase-functions logger
- When working with Firebase projects, check firebase.json for enabled services
- Use Firebase emulators for local development and testing
- Reference firebase-debug.log when troubleshooting Firebase CLI errors
- After adding dependencies to Functions, run `npm install` in the functions directory

# Firebase-specific guidelines

- Always authenticate with `firebase login` before project operations  
- Use `firebase use <project-id>` to switch between projects
- Deploy specific services with `--only` flag (e.g., `firebase deploy --only functions,hosting`)
