## ## Here's an example of how to add generated SDKs.
## ## You'll need to replace the outputDirs with ones pointing to where you want the generated code in your app.
# generate:
#   javascriptSdk:
#     outputDir: <Path where you want the generated SDK to be written to, relative to this file>
#     package: "@firebasegen/my-connector"
#     packageJsonDir: < Optional. Path to your Javascript app's package.json>
#   swiftSdk:
#     outputDir: <Path where you want the generated SDK to be written to, relative to this file>
#     package: "firebasegen/default"
#   kotlinSdk:
#     outputDir: <Path where you want the generated SDK to be written to, relative to this file>
#     package: connectors.default
