# Firebase CLI [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-ci] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-badge]][coveralls] [![Node Version][node-badge]][npm] [![NPM version][npm-badge]][npm]

The Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) Tools can be used to test, manage, and deploy your Firebase project from the command line.

* Deploy code and assets to your Firebase projects
* Run a local web server for your Firebase Hosting site
* Interact with data in your Firebase database
* Import/Export users into/from Firebase Auth

To get started with the Firebase CLI, read the full list of commands below or check out the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli).

## Installation

### Node Package

You can install the Firebase CLI using npm (the Node Package Manager).  Note that you will need to install 
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Installing Node.js should install npm as well.

To download and install the Firebase CLI run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

This will provide you with the globally accessible `firebase` command.

### Standalone Binary

The standalone binary distribution of the Firebase CLI allows you to download a `firebase` executable
without any dependencies.

To download and install the CLI run the following command:

```bash
curl -sL firebase.tools | bash
```

## Commands

**The command `firebase --help` lists the available commands and `firebase <command> --help` shows more details for an individual command.**

If a command is project-specific, you must either be inside a project directory with an
active project alias or specify the Firebase project id with the `-P <project_id>` flag.

Below is a brief list of the available commands and their function:

### Configuration Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**login** | Authenticate to your Firebase account. Requires access to a web browser.
**logout** | Sign out of the Firebase CLI.
**login:ci** | Generate an authentication token for use in non-interactive environments.
**use** | Set active Firebase project, manage project aliases.
**open** | Quickly open a browser to relevant project resources.
**init** | Setup a new Firebase project in the current directory. This command will create a `firebase.json` configuration file in your current directory.
**help** | Display help information about the CLI or specific commands.

Append `--no-localhost` to login (i.e., `firebase login --no-localhost`) to copy and paste code instead of starting a local server for authentication. A use case might be if you SSH into an instance somewhere and you need to authenticate to Firebase on that machine.

### Project Management Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**apps:create** | Create a new Firebase app in a project.
**apps:list** | List the registered apps of a Firebase project.
**apps:sdkconfig** | Print the configuration of a Firebase app.
**projects:addfirebase** | Add Firebase resources to a Google Cloud Platform project.
**projects:create** | Create a new Firebase project.
**projects:list** | Print a list of all of your Firebase projects.

### Deployment and Local Emulation

These commands let you deploy and interact with your Firebase services.

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**emulators:exec** | Start the local Firebase emulators, run a test script, then shut down the emulators.
**emulators:start** | Start the local Firebase emulators.
**deploy** | Deploys your Firebase project. Relies on `firebase.json` configuration and your local project folder.
**serve** | Start a local server with your Firebase Hosting configuration and HTTPS-triggered Cloud Functions. Relies on `firebase.json`.
**setup:emulators:database** | Downloads the database emulator.
**setup:emulators:firestore** | Downloads the firestore emulator.

### App Distribution Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**appdistribution:distribute** | Upload a distribution.

### Auth Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**auth:import** | Batch importing accounts into Firebase from data file.
**auth:export** | Batch exporting accounts from Firebase into data file.

Detailed doc is [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/auth).

### Realtime Database Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**database:get** | Fetch data from the current project's database and display it as JSON. Supports querying on indexed data.
**database:set** | Replace all data at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:push** | Push new data to a list at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:remove** | Delete all data at a specified location in the current project's database.
**database:update** | Perform a partial update at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:profile** | Profile database usage and generate a report.
**database:instances:create** | Create a realtime database instance.
**database:instances:list** | List realtime database instances.
**database:settings:get** | Read the realtime database setting at path

**ext:info** | Display information about an extension by name (extensionName@x.y.z for a specific version)
**ext:install** | Install an extension.
**ext:list** | List all the extensions that are installed in your Firebase project.
**ext:uninstall** | Uninstall an extension that is installed in your Firebase project by Instance ID.
**ext:update** | Update an existing extension instance to the latest version.


### Cloud Firestore Commands

## Using with CI Systems

The Firebase CLI requires a browser to complete authentication, but is fully
compatible with CI and other headless environments.

1. On a machine with a browser, install the Firebase CLI.
2. Run `firebase login:ci` to log in and print out a new [refresh token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
   (the current CLI session will not be affected).
3. Store the output token in a secure but accessible way in your CI system.

There are two ways to use this token when running Firebase commands:

1. Store the token as the environment variable `FIREBASE_TOKEN` and it will
   automatically be utilized.
2. Run all commands with the `--token <token>` flag in your CI system.

The order of precedence for token loading is flag, environment variable, active project.

On any machine with the Firebase CLI, running `firebase logout --token <token>`
will immediately revoke access for the specified token.

## Using as a Module

The Firebase CLI can also be used programmatically as a standard Node module. Each command is exposed as a function that takes an options object and returns a Promise. For example:

```js
var client = require('firebase-tools');
client.list().then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
}).catch(function(err) {
  // handle error
});

client.deploy({
  project: 'myfirebase',
  token: process.env.FIREBASE_TOKEN,
  force: true,
  cwd: '/path/to/project/folder'
}).then(function() {
  console.log('Rules have been deployed!')
}).catch(function(err) {
  // handle error
});
```

Note: when used in a limited environment like Cloud Functions, not all `firebase-tools` commands will work programatically
because they require access to a local filesystem.
