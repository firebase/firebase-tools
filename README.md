# Firebase CLI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/firebase-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/firebase-tools) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/firebase/firebase-tools.svg?branch=master&style=flat)](https://coveralls.io/r/firebase/firebase-tools) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/firebase-tools.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/firebase-tools)

These are the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) Tools. They can be used to:

* Deploy code and assets to your Firebase projects
* Run a local web server for your Firebase Hosting site
* Interact with data in your Firebase database
* Import/Export users into/from Firebase Auth

To get started with the Firebase CLI, read the full list of commands below or check out the [hosting-specific CLI documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart).


## Installation

To install the Firebase CLI, you first need to [sign up for a Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/).

Then you need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Note that
installing Node.js should install npm as well.

Once npm is installed, get the Firebase CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

This will provide you with the globally accessible `firebase` command.


## Commands

**The command `firebase --help` lists the available commands and `firebase <command> --help` shows more details for an individual command.**

If a command is project-specific, you must either be inside a project directory with an
active project alias or specify the Firebase project id with the `-P <project_id>` flag.

Below is a brief list of the available commands and their function:

### Administrative Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**login** | Authenticate to your Firebase account. Requires access to a web browser.
**logout** | Sign out of the Firebase CLI.
**login:ci** | Generate an authentication token for use in non-interactive environments.
**list** | Print a list of all of your Firebase projects.
**setup:web** | Print out SDK setup information for the Firebase JS SDK.
**use** | Set active Firebase project, manage project aliases.
**open** | Quickly open a browser to relevant project resources.
**init** | Setup a new Firebase project in the current directory. This command will create a `firebase.json` configuration file in your current directory.
**help** | Display help information about the CLI or specific commands.

Append `--no-localhost` to login (i.e., `firebase login --no-localhost`) to copy and paste code instead of starting a local server for authentication. A use case might be if you SSH into an instance somewhere and you need to authenticate to Firebase on that machine. 

### Deployment and Local Development

These commands let you deploy and interact with your Firebase Hosting site.

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**deploy** | Deploys your Firebase project. Relies on `firebase.json` configuration and your local project folder.
**serve** | Start a local web server with your Firebase Hosting configuration. Relies on `firebase.json`.

### Auth Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**auth:import** | Batch importing accounts into Firebase from data file.
**auth:export** | Batch exporting accounts from Firebase into data file.

Detailed doc is [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/auth).

### Database Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**database:get** | Fetch data from the current project's database and display it as JSON. Supports querying on indexed data.
**database:set** | Replace all data at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:push** | Push new data to a list at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:remove** | Delete all data at a specified location in the current project's database.
**database:update** | Perform a partial update at a specified location in the current project's database. Takes input from file, STDIN, or command-line argument.
**database:profile** | Profile database usage and generate a report.

### Cloud Functions Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**functions:log** | Read logs from deployed Cloud Functions.
**functions:config:set** | Store runtime configuration values for the current project's Cloud Functions.
**functions:config:get** | Retrieve existing configuration values for the current project's Cloud Functions.
**functions:config:unset** | Remove values from the current project's runtime configuration.
**functions:config:clone** | Copy runtime configuration from one project environment to another.

### Hosting Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
**hosting:disable** | Stop serving Firebase Hosting traffic for the active project. A "Site Not Found" message will be displayed at your project's Hosting URL after running this command.

## Using with CI Systems

The Firebase CLI requires a browser to complete authentication, but is fully
compatible with CI and other headless environments.

1. On a machine with a browser, install the Firebase CLI.
2. Run `firebase login:ci` to log in and print out a new access token
   (the current CLI session will not be affected).
3. Store the output token in a secure but accessible way in your CI system.

There are two ways to use this token when running Firebase commands:

1. Store the token as the environment variable `FIREBASE_TOKEN` and it will
   automatically be utilized.
2. Run all commands with the `--token <token>` flag in your CI system.

The order of precedence for token loading is flag, environment variable, active project.

On any machine with the Firebase CLI, running `firebase logout --token <token>`
will immediately revoke access for the specified token.

## Using as a Module

The Firebase CLI can also be used programmatically as a standard Node module. Each command is exposed as a function that takes an options object and returns a Promise. For example:

```js
var client = require('firebase-tools');
client.list().then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
}).catch(function(err) {
  // handle error
});

client.deploy({
  project: 'myfirebase',
  token: process.env.FIREBASE_TOKEN,
  cwd: '/path/to/project/folder'
}).then(function() {
  console.log('Rules have been deployed!')
}).catch(function(err) {
  // handle error
});
```
