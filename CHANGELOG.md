- Fixed an issue where the emulator would fail to start when using `firebase-functions` v7+ (#9401).
- Added `functions.list_functions` as a MCP tool (#9369)
- Added AI Logic to `firebase init` CLI command and `firebase_init` MCP tool. (#9185)
- Improved error messages for Firebase AI Logic provisioning during 'firebase init' (#9377)
- Added `appdistribution:testcases:export` and `appdistribution:testcases:import` (#9397)
- Updated to v2.16.0 of the Data Connect emulator, which includes internal improvements.
- Data Connect now allows executing a valid query / operation even if the other operations are invalid. (This toleration provides convenience on a best-effort basis. Some errors like invalid syntax can still cause the whole request to be rejected.)
- Fixed enum list deserialization in Data Connect generated Dart SDKs.
- Added GraphQL `__typename` support in Data Connect.
- Support enum values in Data Connect CEL expressions.
- Support `_id`, a global ID field in Data Connect.
