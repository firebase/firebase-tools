- Fixed issue where `__name__` fields with DESCENDING order were incorrectly filtered from index listings, causing duplicate index issues (#7629) and deployment conflicts (#8859). The fix now preserves `__name__` fields with explicit DESCENDING order while filtering out implicit ASCENDING `__name__` fields.
- Fixed an issue where `firebase init dataconnect` didn't enable the Data Connect API by default (#8927).
- Add firebase init aitools to help developers set up Firebase AI tools in their projects (#8949).
