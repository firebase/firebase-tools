- Fixed an issue where `firebase init dataconnect` didn't enable the Data Connect API by default (#8927).

  - [Fixed] Kotlin code generation with enums
  - [Fixed] Deploying schemas with enums would report false breaking changes
  - [Added] Support for ordering results by aggregate fields (min/max/count/sum/avg).
  - [Added] Support for built-in and user-defined enums to LLM Tools generation.
