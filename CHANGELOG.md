- Added a deprecation warning for functions.config() to stderr on deploy and all functions:config commands. (#8808)
- Added analytics to track runtime config usage in functions deployments (#8870).
- Fixed issue where `__name__` fields with DESCENDING order were incorrectly filtered from index listings, causing duplicate index issues (#7629) and deployment conflicts (#8859). The fix now preserves `__name__` fields with explicit DESCENDING order while filtering out implicit ASCENDING `__name__` fields.
