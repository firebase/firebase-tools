- Added a deprecation warning for functions.config() to stderr on deploy and all functions:config commands. (#8808)
- Added analytics to track runtime config usage in functions deployments (#8870).
- Fixed issue where `__name__` fields with DESCENDING order were incorrectly filtered from index listings, causing duplicate index issues (#7629) and deployment conflicts (#8859). The fix now preserves `__name__` fields with explicit DESCENDING order while filtering out implicit ASCENDING `__name__` fields.
- Add service account and service enablement to `firebase init apptesting`
- Updated the Firebase Data Connect local toolkit to v2.10.1, which includes the following changes: (#8884)
    - [fixed] Dart codegen: Issue where list enums weren't properly serialized and deserialized.
    - [fixed] Dart codegen: Issue where if a Variable class has a field that is a custom scalar type, and that field has an enum, the enum is set to the incorrect type.
    - [fixed] Swift codegen: For enum cases that are not known to the SDK in advance, Swift generates a `_UNKNOWN` case with a string associated value.  The fix changes that case name from `UNKNOWN` to `_UNKNOWN`. If you have existing generated enums, you may need to rebuild your project.
    - [fixed] Kotlin codegen: Add `value` property to the `EnumValue` base interface.
    - [fixed] Dart codegen: Issue where nullable enum fields weren't setting the field itself as nullable.
