- Fixed an issue with deploying indexes to Firestore Enterprise edition databases where explicit `__name__` fields could be incorrectly handled.
- The `experimental:mcp` command has been renamed to `mcp`. The old name is now an alias.
- `firebase_update_environment` MCP tool supports accepting Gemini in Firebase Terms of Service.
- Fixed a bug when `firebase init dataconnect` failed to create a React app when launched from VS Code extension (#9171).
- Improved the clarity of the `firebase apptesting:execute` command when you have zero or multiple apps.
- `firebase dataconnect:sql:migrate` now supports Cloud SQL instances with only private IPs. The command must be run in the same VPC of the instance to work. (##9200)
