- Removed MCP tools and prompts that required Gemini in Firebase terms of service.
- Fixes an issue where the `--only` flag was not always respected for `firebase mcp`
- Fix proxy.js/proxy.ts in Next.js 16 (#9631)
- Removed timeout when connecting to Cloud SQL. Hopefully, should mitigate issue #9314. (#9725)
