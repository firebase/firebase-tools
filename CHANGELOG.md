- Adds `ext:dev:*` commands to publish and manage Extensions. For step-by-step instructions on how to publish your own Extensions, see https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/publishers/get-started.
  - Note: These commands were previously available to early access users behind an experiment flag. There are some breaking changes from the early access version of these commands.
  - `ext:dev:publish` has been renamed to `ext:dev:upload`. `ext:dev:upload` defaults to uploading extensions from GitHub instead of local source.
  - `ext:dev:publish` is deprecated and will be removed in version 13.
  - `ext:dev:delete`, `ext:dev:unpublish`, `ext:sources:create` and `ext:dev:emualtors:*` have been removed.
