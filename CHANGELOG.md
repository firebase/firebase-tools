- Fixed a bug where `@transaction` continued to execute after errors and produces more confusing errors.
- Fixed a bug where rolled-back fields in `@transaction` returned bogus data that had been invalidated by the rollback. They now correctly return null with a corresponding error "(rolled back)".
- Disallow `@check` on side-effect fields if the mutation doesn't have `@transaction`.
- Improved error messages when reading a field of `null` in CEL expressions.
- Updated the underlying Go dependency version from v1.22.2 to v1.22.12.
- Added the `response` binding to Server Values and `@check(expr:)` CEL expressions.
