Have a feature request?
========================
Great, we love hearing how we can improve our products! However, GitHub is not the place to submit them. Please submit your feature requests to:

**Think you found a bug?** Please do not use this template - use the `🐛 Bug report` template.

Have a usage question?
=======================
We get lots of those and we love helping you, but GitHub is not the best place for them and they
will be closed. Here are some resources to get help:

- Start with the quickstart: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/write-firebase-functions
- Go through the guide: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/
- Read the full API reference: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/functions/
- Browse some examples: https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples

If the official documentation doesn't help, try asking through our official support channels:
